## Scenario Design Analysis

### Who are the target users?

Netflix targets a broad audience of individuals who are interested in seeing movies and TV shows online. Traditionally, Netflix's age demographic is skewed towards a younger audience (Gen Z and millennials). 75% of Netflix users in the US are between 18 and 34 years old. [@Netflix]

Netflix also targets a global audience. The US and Canada accounts for the majority of Netflix subscribers. However, recently its reach in Europe, Middle East and Asia has increased dramatically.

## What are their key goals?

<div>

The key goals of Netflix users are to:
:::

</div>

```{r}
1 + 1
```

You can add options to executable code like this

```{r}
#| echo: false
2 * 2
```

The `echo: false` option disables the printing of code (only output is displayed).
